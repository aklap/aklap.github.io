What do you ask in an interview? I decided to write down my own questions and find out what other people were asking, too. 

Before some recent interviews I didn't do much research about what I was _supposed_ to be asking my potential employer; I just wrote down all the questions that I really wanted answers to, (the 'naive' approach before refactoring, if you will). I think that should be everyone's starting point: brainstorm the questions you really want answers to, not just what you think you *should* be saying to potentially impress them.  

On a recommendation, I compared my list of questions to Julia Evans' list and a list she references over the weekend, and felt relieved that I seemed to be on the right track as we both had similar questions.  

So, here are most of mine, grouped thematically, and for a developer or engineer position, (but I think that these apply to a wide range of work). Some may apply to you, some not, and I've left out some that are pretty standard, (specifically, compensation/vacation). 

**Remote Working**

*(I ask this because some places say remote but they may have coworking spaces or an office or meet regularly in person.)*

-  If they're distributed or remote: Tell me how your team implements remote working? What does 'remote' mean to you? 

-  What are some challenges/benefits to having a remote team at your company?

- How do you support someone with less experience/new to the team if everyone is remote?

**Performance**

*(If there aren't regular code reviews, especially as some with less experience, that really concerns me. Even with more experience, I would still be concerned.)*

-  ‘Code reviews are important to me. What are they like? How often are they? And how important?’

-  How would my performance be measured in this position?

-  Who gets to decide what an employee or employees work on?

**Deployment**

-  What kind of coding standards does your company use? Can you tell me about them?

-  What kind of workflow does your team use, (i.e., Agile or something else?)

- How do you test your code? How important is testing? 

(*I don't love this, but it's okay as an icebreaker or if you're really curious. Also, if they aren't very open-minded or condescend about the tools you're using now, than that's a red flag.*)

-  What tools does your company use?

-  What’s your deployment process like?

- How many people work on a project?

- Is there a team structure or hierarchy?

**Diversity/Demographics**

*(These are some of the questions I may ask, but ask ones that are relevant to you, your safety, & sense of inclusion.)*

-  What is the team like, and how experienced are they? (Ratio of juniors to seniors?)

-  What does your company do to to foster diversity and inclusiveness? (Specific examples.)

-  What is the percentage of women at your company?

-  Can you provide data on diversity at your company?

**Growth**

-  Is there room for creativity? How do you foster it?

-  What opportunities are there for growth? Can you change responsibilities or teams?

*(Depending on what the specific job title is...)*

-  How much outside hiring is there vs. internal promotion?

**Learning while working:**

-  How is your company a [‘learning organization’](https://confreaks.tv/videos/devopsdaysnewyork2016-blue-grass-in-a-brown-field-building-awesome-people-and-a-culture-of-learning)?

-  What opportunities are there for learning on the job or while hired? (Budget for conferences, events, books, courses, etc.)

-  How does your company handle failure?

-  What happens if I didn't know something/was stuck? (i.e., resources.)

**Mentorship**

-  What opportunities are there for mentorship?

-  Can you tell me about what mentorship is like in your company?

-  Can you switch mentors?

**Performance:**

-  What’s an example of your company’s cultures/values? (Specific examples.)

-  How am I and my performance evaluated? How often?

-  What is your team working on right now?

-  What’s the most pressing challenge your team is working on right now?

**Non-traditional hires:**

*(This will give you a feel about how the company feels about non-traditional hires, good or bad, so it's important! Plus, you want to know what their experiences have been.)*

-  What do you see as the top challenge or challenges for a hire w/a non-traditional background? 

-  What do you see as the top challenge or challenges for a someone w/a traditional computer science degree? 

*(This question is important: If you get hired this is your roadmap.)*

-  How did employees with those non-traditional backgrounds overcome those challenges?

**Feedback**

-  What was your overall impression of my resumé?

-  What do you think about my projects?

*(I have a project that could be considered political, so I like to ask what the interviewer thinks of it, and if that might cause a problem with the company)*

-  What do you think about this project and do you think this position would pose a problem for me or the company?

-  How well am I communicating during this interview?

*(If there were some technical questions...)*

-  How well did I answer your question(s)? Did I answer adequately or was there something I could improve on?

**At the end:**

*(I copped this from somewhere but can't find the original source; I do remember that the writer said to ask this at the end of the interview to end on a positive note & where the focus isn't on you/give yourself a break.)*

-  What was your best moment/favorite memory with your company? 

-  What was your proudest moment with your company?

**Go deep.**

One of the things I've found too formulaic and unsatisfactory about these types of interactions is when the questions go to things like tooling, (except in some cases). It's sort of the bottom of the barrel when you and your interviewer are grasping at things to talk about, (maybe even the equivalent of 'How's the weather?'). It's a lot more revealing and engaging to go a level deeper and ask for their opinions and for their own personal experiences, and I tend toward asking those questions.

**Ask for feedback during the interview, not after.**

Some good questions to ask are to ask for feedback *during* the interview, rather then waiting until after the interview and possibly being ignored. 

This is not my idea; I read a great article on interview questions but sadly, can't remember the site or author! (If anyone knows, please leave a comment with it.) The original article I read said that after rounds of interviews asking about text editors and source control a candidate who was not a native English speaker repeatedly asked for feedback about how they were communicating and how well they seemed to comprehend concepts; the author/interviewer found it refreshing and said they would much rather see this deeper level of reflection from an interviewee. 

**It's all about you.**

It really is. Some interviews might go great... and you'll never hear back. Some seem clunky and awkward and somehow you'll move to the next round. The only way to survive this without losing all sense of self is to take it for what it is with little expectation, and use it to mine all the information you possibly can about the company and its culture. If you use it to do due diligence instead of just flattering  your interviewer or guessing what they want, it'll be far more useful to you and less work intensive on your part. So ask the questions you need to ask for your peace of mind.

**What do you all ask during your interviews? Are there questions you must ask in every interview?**
