After spending a few days at a conference, there’s a few threads that I picked up on in conversations that went on especially when it came to inclusivity and career paths that stuck with me. With the benefit of time and hindsight, I want to address some of them.

**Mentoring as a job responsibility**

As a heads up, I’m going to use mentor and teacher interchangeably for the sake of this discussion.

For most of this year, I was an instructor for children learning to code. Since this was my first formal teaching position, I learned by observation and experience the importance of setting clear boundaries and expectations when in a mentoring position. My only other experience prior to this working with children had been a volunteer mentor position I held with the [Pajama Program](http://www.pajamaprogram.org/). It was informal and relaxed, and most importantly since I was working for free, I felt little pressure either to produce results or communicate in a certain way. When you are mentoring as part of your paid work, things do change.

What I mostly hear when I hear folks in tech talk about mentoring is a lot of reticence to take on a mentee at work, and resistance to upper management for foisting a junior person onto them leading to what can only be described as deliberately sabotaging work relationships and duties.

**Here’s the facts: If mentoring is a part of your responsibilities at work, you need to accept it.** If you’ve already had a discussion with your boss/manager/whatever about your reticence to mentor and the outcome was that you still had to mentor, guess what? You need to mentor. If that is still unacceptable to you, please find another job without this responsibility or consider taking on less responsibility by changing positions.

It is also wrong (yes, I’m going to use morality here, which I normally hate doing) to dump extra responsibilities onto your co-workers who may already be mentoring someone else, and it is unfair to the people they are already mentoring to make them share their mentor. Particularly egregious to me is when the person that needs to be mentored is part of a minority group with historically limited access to resources and a network; derailing someone’s career at the early stages who truly needs support, while deceiving your boss or colleagues is pretty much indefensible and unforgivable to me. 

Saying that someone doesn’t seem passionate about the work is also not a good enough reason to not do your job and mentor them. For that I will refer you to [Sarah Mei’s thread on passion here](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/770815851964403712). It’s also glaringly obvious that fixating on cultural fit or passion can be used to the detriment of inclusivity and mask some really ugly prejudices.

Sometimes we have to do things for work that are ethically good, make business sense, yet feel deeply uncomfortable. Now is not the time to let your need for comfort overtake the other two considerations.

**Nurturing vs. mentoring**

Great, you’ve accepted you need to do your job. Congratulations. Think: Were you good at every technology you use now on the first day you discovered it? No, but you experimented, you adapted, you learned. This is the attitude you need to take with mentoring. No one is born a perfect teacher or mentor, you learn to be one. One of the most disconcerting comments I heard was that some people were naturally good at mentoring because they were ’nurturing’ and others just aren’t because they were not born with a capability to nurture, and we all need to accept that. This is a deeply problematic framing of what it means to be a mentor, given that gender essentialism assigns ’nurturing’ to women and justifies a whole host of responsibilities and labor onto them without real reason. It also underestimates the plasticity of the human brain to adapt and communicate, in addition to your professionalism.

On a practical note, this attitude concerns me were a co-worker to shirk their duties as a mentor, the outcome might be to dump that responsibility onto employees typed as nurturing without reason (hi, ladies!) and without repercussion. If I were to hear this in a job interview it would be a huge red flag to me.

So let’s rethink mentorship by removing the intimacy and emotional labor that we associate with a parent-child relationship or romantic one, by framing a mentorship within the confines of work-related skills and milestones. How? Like any relationship, ambiguity gives rise to misunderstanding. It behooves you to be patient and willing to communicate explicitly with your student or mentee as well as your boss what skills need to be learned, within what time frame, the language to be used when communicating and forms of acceptable communication. And not just once. You may have to keep iterating on these things through your time mentoring this individual. You may need to draw up lists of skills, negotiate time frames and resources, and spend a session with your mentee just discussing how to communicate, (as in literally what words are okay to use and what aren’t), as tedious as this may seem. As someone pointed out in a breakout session, not everyone wants to be 'nurtured,' they just might want a code review. And the only way you are going to know that is if you start talking to your mentee. Accept that without doing this you may be opening an abyss of misunderstandings and setbacks.

**Learning how to communicate: Interviewer effect**

Part of a successful mentorship in my mind is the ability to give and receive a stream of consistent feedback. Checking in frequently with your student is good, but be mindful of the way in which you do that. There may be times when either you or your mentee may find this inefficient at best, emotionally draining at worst. 

Also be mindful of framing questions in a binary way that implies success or failure, particularly, in front of peers, (this can make stand-ups into St.Sebastian-like ordeals for some people). Be familiar with the [interviewer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interviewer_effect), a well understood concept in anthropology that needs to be brought over to mentorship training in tech. As anthropologists conducted interviews with their study subjects they realized that the answers they were getting from their interviewees were at odds with what they had observed, or perhaps were outright lies. The interviewees wanted to please or flatter the interviewer, responding in ways that reflected the distorting effects of power and cultural expectations. The same is true when you ask someone, "Aren't you already finished with that?" or "You understand everything, right?"

(As an aside, I’ve long wondered why HR employees, managers and mentors don’t study anthropological methodologies.)

**Learning organizations: Making work a safe space to fail**

A great thing I learned when working with kids is that **everything can be hard.** The same holds true for adults. Ease of learning is relative for a host of reasons, so be aware of using patterns of speech that imply something should have been easy. 

Seek to make your organization, a [learning organization](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-newyork/program/nivia-henry/) where failure is inevitable when learning, where it is a constructive tool for it, and where work is a sandbox for it. I’ve had more success with students speaking about their progress with concepts by not asking them to quantify their work or speak in binary terms, but by speaking with them one on one and asking them to report their feelings on projects, concepts, and after I’ve explained something. (I've had people laugh in my face when I tell them this, but it works.)

Do not interrupt them, cut them off, or make assumptions about why or how they feel, but patiently let them finish. If they do not feel confident about something, reign in the feeling to be defensive or make a judgment, and acknowledge that you’ve heard them; be constructive, ask more specifically about why they don’t feel good about something and if they have any thoughts about what ‘we’ can do to change that or how you can help. Look for keywords in what they say that signal other causes for their discomfort or lack of progress in their work. 

Your student or mentee might not have the confidence right now to make any real suggestions for improvement, but you left the door open for them to. That's important in building confidence and trust.

**Setting boundaries and expectations**

The bedrock of setting boundaries and expectations is communication. What does this mean? It means being a good active listener, which is really being a patient listener. Give your student your undivided attention; let them finish their sentences instead of cutting them off; and don’t make assumptions about what they want to do or how they understand things. And it also means being explicit about what you are comfortable with and what your expectations are. Don’t make mentoring into a game of cat and mouse x gotcha! Make learning goals small and bite-sized, with shorter rather than long time frames. Sometimes people need to feel like they got a ‘win’ however small it is to propel them to the next big idea or milestone.

**Ask yourself how much of yourself you are willing to give.** 

Boundaries mean many things. 

Perhaps you only want to mentor someone during work hours, maybe you are open to meeting up with them after work or on weekends. Do you want to keep conversation to just work-related tasks or are you comfortable with listening or relating to personal, non-work discussions, too? How will you speak to one another? Are words or topics off limits? Are there ways of communicating that someone finds useful but perhaps you are uncomfortable with? Are you going to give them your phone number or ask them to just keep it to email? Is this mentorship also about developing leadership and interpersonal skills? All things to consider and discuss. 

**If something, whatever that is, is inappropriate or goes beyond what you are comfortable with as a mentor, you need to be respectful but explicit and firm that your mentorship does not allow for that behavior.**

**Final thoughts and the possibility of failure**

This is a wholly incomplete guide to mentorship, but can be meant to function as a starting off point for your own journey as a mentor. As someone that preferred never to be the teacher or guide, I discovered that mentorships can be powerful tools for self-awareness and growth. 

One of the things that is hardest about being a mentor is the reality and knowledge that you will fuck up: some way, some how. The trick is handling that with grace. You'll say the wrong thing, you'll neglect a task, you'll ignore something of importance. This is inevitable. But having the self-awareness to accept and verbalize! that you are culpable, the agility of mind to change tactics or teaching methods, the ability to remain calm rather than be short-tempered, will help you keep the respect of your mentee(s) and keep your mentorship productive. 

It's also totally valid and possible you are not ready to mentor this specific person or at this time. Be honest and upfront with all the parties involved about that, too. But of course, you might even enjoy being a mentor! You might grow to like and respect your mentee! These are possibilities you'll only know if you engage with your discomfort and dive into mentorship.

Besides, given the choice of finding a junior employee, would you rather have a hand in and some control over their work habits and knowledge, or none at all?
