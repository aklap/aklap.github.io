title: You don’t need to do hackathons to program

I’ve been wanting to write about hackathons and why I don’t think programmers, especially new ones, should go to them.

When I first started to learn about programming I had heard of hackathons but had little idea about what they were or what went on. I didn’t have much interest in them. I was just trying to understand fundamental concepts and hadn’t thought too far ahead. But again and again, I had people telling me that I should, no needed, to go to hackathons, and definitely if I wanted a job. I felt pressure to attend and produce something that would legitimize me as a ‘real’ programmer/coder.

Now that I’ve been to a few, I think I can say with some certainty: **I don’t like them and don’t think they are productive learning experiences for most new programmers.**

**Can be hard to find a team.**

Hackathons are a bit of a rigged game; if you can round up a team of people that you know and are familiar with their abilities, then you’re way ahead of the game. This favors more experienced programmers and can result in a cliquish atmosphere in the space. People who are new to programming or going to their first hackathon are probably alone and going into an unfamiliar environment that’s already intimidating. Having to pitch yourself to complete strangers if you’re introverted or have social anxiety makes it an ordeal.

**Excessive competition.**

For the same reason that I feel uneasy watching the Olympics or any mass display of nationalism and competition, hackathons give me weird, bad feels. Going into a space where people are grouped together, at times dressed in the same t-shirts or hoodies from whatever school or bootcamp they attended, or company they work for, to compete against one another for a prize, conflicts with my love of individualism and belief in programming for curiosity’s sake. Plus, I haven’t worn the same clothes as someone else since I was a teenager in private school, and don’t plan on wearing matching outfits with anyone ever again if I can help it.

The biggest thing that I’ve realized when I’m at a hackathon is that I enjoy collaboration not competition.

**Unhealthy habits.**

When I finally realized I disliked hackathons, I did what everyone who has a secret, guilty thought does: Google it. The most frequent complaint about hackathons I’ve come across is that they encourage unhealthy behavior, usually lack of sleep and poor eating habits. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you, in any way, need to get a decent night’s rest or eat well (whatever that may mean for you) to maintain your mental or physical health, then hackathons might not be for you.

**Not a great experience for beginners.**

At one hackathon, after noticing some young girls who were attending were stuck on creating a backend for their project, I told a 'mentor' that they needed assistance. The answer: ’tell them to use Meteor.js.’ This is not a productive or helpful thing to tell already intimidated young girls who haven’t done much more than HTML/CSS. It’s the answer of someone that isn’t actively listening and can’t be bothered. Don’t do this.

The other behavior I’ve observed between experienced and beginner programmers is that they overwhelm and confuse the beginner with acronyms and technical terminology.

Challenge yourself to find simple ways to express complex ideas without condescension; it can be done.

**Lack of Fairness**

The worst hackathons are the ones where you don’t code, which is entirely possible.

In my experience, usually someone had already done a project that did what the theme of the hackathon was, so there was no need to do anything more. An acquaintance told me that their classmate had won prizes by submitting the same project to different hackathons over and over again. In other situations, I’ve questioned the relationship between the winners and organizers/judges/organizations. Basically, the playing field isn't exactly level. 

**Poor planning/bad leadership/unsafe environment**

I've been to hackathons where they had little to no guidance or help, and people that were designated as ‘mentors’ were not always on the floor or disappeared altogether after Day 1. At the hackathon I mentioned above, since there were not enough mentors at that event, adults were competing with the kids for help.

Other bad signs? The schedule mysteriously changed to end the event early, and there wasn’t any drinks or food for some meals. One of the sponsor's employees slapped me so hard on my shoulder that I lost balance; I think they meant it in a friendly way but touching an attendee without their consent at an event is not okay. It's also really unprofessional.

I ended up helping a group of teen girls to present their app and gave them my laptop to use. The organizer said they would put the girls up earlier in the schedule to demo; they lied. (Yes, they lied to children. I was mortified, then angry when I realized what they were doing.) I scrambled to find someone who would stay to the end of the event (I had to leave early) and set up the app on their computer. I later found out the girls presented dead last (not first as the organizer had told me) and took home nothing; they were demoralized by the experience. This is exactly how you lose girls interest in coding.

The moral of this story, and what I have heard from other developers is that if you go to an event and for whatever reason don’t feel like you are safe or enjoying it on Day 1: Leave.

If there are red flags (condescending, abusive language/behavior, lack of food/water, no organization or mentorship): Leave.

A good measure of an event or organization is to see if they have a CoC or Code of Conduct. Some communities are well known for their commitment to a CoC and ensuring a respectful and open space for attendees, like the Python community is. The hackathon I mentioned didn't have one that I can recall, but they discussed the terms of IP ownership for the event--clearly they were more concerned with property than attendees' experience or wellbeing.

**It’s more about business than programming, (aka that icky feel of capitalism).**

Sad but true. Scrutinize the companies sponsoring and organizing the hackathon. They may be looking for ideas/projects/your code to use themselves; do you know what rights you have over your work? 

Realize they're doing this because it makes business sense, first and foremost.

*So what am I supposed to do?*

Okay. You’ve got options. There are places you can go sans the above or at least where they try to mitigate it as much possible.

- **Open source projects.** These are notorious for being unfriendly to beginners, but Mozilla, Drupal, and Free Code Camp are good places to start and get support from more experienced contributors.

- **CTFs and wargames.** You want competition and a challenge? Try a CTF or wargame. You often can do these alone or at your own pace.

- **Meetups.** Look for groups that share your values, even if they may not be tech related or running a hackathon. Good things come from good people. Surround yourself with them.

- **Look for ’show and tell’ type groups.** Hack&&Tell is one.

- **Hackerspaces.** See if you have any around you; often they will run workshops and provide a friendlier, non-competitive atmosphere. Check and see what their values are, and if they have a CoC.

- **Social media.** Follow people you have common interests and values with. Reach out to them for suggestions re: projects, spaces, people to work with. The worst that can happen is that they don’t respond.

- **Mentorship programs.** Look up RC Start, Outreachy. These are free programs that can introduce you to a community and find people to work on projects with.

- **Work on your own projects!** The best projects are the ones that you come up with because you need it. You’ll have the satisfaction of being hands-on and building something yourself.

I want to stress that you do not need to go to hackathons to be a ‘real’ programmer. You don’t need to go to them to be a great one. Many of the people I've met in NY have programmed for years and never gone to one. The focus on hackathons I think is related to what Sarah Mei described in a great Twitter thread recently, which is that passion is expected to be demonstrated in a very particular way in order for someone to be legitimized and their skills given value.

That, and businesses have seized on the trendiness of hackathons. Don't fall for that. Use your time wisely, meaningfully, programming in the environment and way that feels best for you. And remember, if you've written a line of code, you are a coder, if you've created a program, you're a programmer. Don't let people tell you otherwise.
