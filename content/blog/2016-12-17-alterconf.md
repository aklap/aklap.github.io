Last week I went to my first AlterConf as a volunteer. Some notes on what I learned. 

I had heard about AlterConf and follow Ashe Dryden on Twitter, but didn't really know what went on during one of these conferences. So, when I happened to read that AlterConf was coming to NY, I decided to check out the schedule and see how much tickets were. 

One of the great things about AlterConf is that it is affordable, (there are tiers of tickets but also a sliding scale), and even lunch and childcare are included. There were also scholarship tickets available, but I decided to volunteer which was easy to do since there was a form on the site to apply. (I usually prefer to volunteer because I'd rather have something to do, mostly).

All of the talks had to do with themes of inclusivity and diversity, which at many conferences might be just one talk out of the day(s), but at AlterConf all the talks were themed this way. The speakers ranged in age, experience, gender, sexuality and race which was really heartening. 

It was also a type of relief to be in a space that was so inclusive and where everyone was being thoughtful in what they said and did; this is not really the norm for most meetups and conferences, where there might not even be a code of conduct or where I might be the only woman or woman of color. It really made a great difference in both the discussions and reception of presentations. 

That kind of friendliness makes me highly recommend going to AlterConf if you are able, (and more cities are hosting them!), and especially, if you are:

- new to programming
- are part of a marginalized group
- are curious about getting into programming or tech 
- care about or are curious about inclusivity and diversity and what they mean

Talks of note with links to video:

 [**It's not Lit: Strategies for Exposing and Eliminating Cultural Appropriation in Marketing**](https://confreaks.tv/videos/alterconfnyc2016-it-s-not-lit-strategies-for-exposing-and-eliminating-cultural-appropriation-in-marketing)<br>
Candace Williams, [@TeacherC](https://twitter.com/TeacherC)

Williams is a former teacher and like so many teachers that have gone on to other professions has been able to use that experience to her advantage when public speaking. (In my experience, I've always found former teachers to be eloquent, thoughtful public speakers with mastery of crowd dynamics and interaction.) 

Her talk touched on appropriation vs. appreciation, using 'under siege' rather than 'marginalized', and how to effectively work towards greater inclusivity and diversity at work without centering yourself and privilege.  

 [**Dismantling the Binary, one Microaggression at a Time**](https://confreaks.tv/videos/alterconfnyc2016-dismantling-the-binary-one-microaggression-at-a-time)<br> 
Jameson Hampton, [@jameybash](https://twitter.com/jameybash)

A generous talk about what microagressions are, examples, and why they are negative behaviors we should all actively work against. 

One of the prompts Hampton gave when you find yourself on the defense or talking excessively about yourself, was: 

__*'This conversation is not about me and that's okay.'*__

My inner monologue: Repeat as needed. 

I thought it went well with Williams' point about not co-opting a discussion to make it about yourself<br> **if you're not the marginalized voice in the room.** (This is key!)

 [**The Cult(ure) of Strength**](https://confreaks.tv/videos/alterconfnyc2016-the-cult-ure-of-strenght)<br> Emily Gorcenski, [@EmilyGorcenski](https://twitter.com/EmilyGorcenski)

A lot of people at AlterConf loved this talk and it was by far the most emotionally impactful of the day. Gorcenski spoke about the usage of 'strength' as a harmful platitude and ideal. It's often used in lieu of meaningful action to increase the safety of marginalized people under threat. Instead 'strength' and comments like 'you need to be stronger', redirects and deflects responsibility from the person with power and privilege, while devaluing vulnerability. 

Some of the slides included personal experiences of encountering this 'strength' ideal in the workplace. Gorcenski's statement of 'I don't want to be stronger, I want to be safe' in the context of both personal experiences of harassment and the election of Donald Trump as president, resonated deeply with the audience.

**More talks of note.**

Other notable talks were Kareem Francis' 'You Make Everything About Race' and Aditya Mukerjee's talk on decolonising programming by making it accessible to non-English speakers. 

There was also a talk with a brief demonstration of what it's like to experience synesthesia, (as someone with chromesthesia it was very close to what I experience!). 

Lizzie Siegle was the youngest speaker but she did a good job in front of a potentially intimidating audience, bringing specific attention to the need to effectively mentor marginalized juniors, (which I think more people need to commit to, hence, [my post here](http://alexislaporte.com/blog/posts/mentoring-as-work)). I had only one quibble with her talk: it's fine to be 'young, scrappy and hungry' a la Hamilton, but you can be old, scrappy and hungry, too!

**The other important part of a conference: the audience.**

After spending a day listening to some great talks, I realized that the other part of the equation of what makes AlterConf a good conference was the audience. Everyone I encountered was friendly and open-minded. When attendees and even Ashe herself, disagreed with a speaker it was done with mutual respect and not the malice and vindictiveness that I've come to brace myself for. (I mean, I went to a conference once and watched Richard Stallman and attendees get into screaming matches, so that's where my bar is.) 

I realized, too that I could recognize other attendees as people I had met from the Recurse Center or feminist and women-centered meetup groups which were happy surprises. It can be isolating trying to break into tech, and it's nice to feel some sort of community, have some sort of recognition, and be at ease to talk about things you care about with someone else. 

All these things have me looking forward to the next AlterConf, and maybe you should be there, too.
