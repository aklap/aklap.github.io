title: John Allspaw on Joint Activity
type: '/blog/post'
layout: 'single'
---

Tonight I went to a Papers We Love meetup. I did not read the paper. Not even the abstract. 

I knew John Allspaw, Etsy's CTO was going to be presenting the paper, and having heard him speak at a Code as Craft event a few months back, was sufficiently confident he would be able to speak about the ideas in the paper in a clear, thoughtful way--meaning I wouldn't need to read the paper. (That's right, I used John Allspaw as a Sparks Note audiobook. I felt slightly better about my intellectual and reading habits when Allspaw said that he wasn't expecting many people to have read the paper, and that the reason he was speaking on it was so that we didn't have to.) An additional fact I found out last night, one I didn't know before the talk, is that Allspaw has a MsC from Lund University in Sweden in Human Factors and Systems Safety.

To be honest, I wasn't even sure what the paper was about other than intuiting that it had something to do with operations and getting people to work together. And since the disastrous final project I had at the bootcamp I went to still lingers in the back of my mind, anything that could provide insight into successful joint work interests me. 

The paper, ["Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity"](http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf), pulls together quite a few subjects that I've been exposed to recently: systems theory and cybernetics, Eden Medina's article on Chile's Cybersyn and Stafford Beer, as well the strong influence of systems researchers like Jay Wright Forrester on George Kemeny's 'Man and the Computer.' The gist of the paper is to examine what makes joint activity work.

<h4>Defining concepts: Common ground, basic compact, repairing</h4>
___
<br>

Allspaw began by spending a fair amount of time ephasizing the concept of __'common ground.'__ Here, he drew attention to the fact that the colloquial 'common ground' is not that of the paper. __It is not a noun or a thing, but assuming a set of beliefs and assumptions held in common among people in a team, is in fact, a *process* of maintaining those understandings.__ I hesitate to make the jump to cultural fit and homogeneity of culture but those associations did come up in my mind listening to him, false or not.

Although I don't have access to his slides, I do recall one he showed with quotes from the paper. One of the quotes was a definition of common ground, and it sounded like a homonym for empathy, or rather since 'common ground' is a verb, empathizing. This is mostly due to the fact that the word 'understanding' was used several times, and the same definition seemed to also imply self-awareness. I don't think it's hard to believe that successful joint activity requires empathy with your teammates as well as self-awareness to position oneself appropriately to your fellow teammates and be able to 'repair' any breakdown between members. However, because of the pop culture trendiness of the word 'empathy', (much like the term 'mindfulness'), I've come to loathe it to a degree, and can understand why it was not used in the paper.

Then there is the 'basic compact.' It's the social contract, if you will, that makes coordinated effort possible. Allspaw brought up that this is often unspoken. 

What I found interesting is the concept of 'repair.' That is, if coordinated effort begins to break down, team members will fix any break down by shoring up and sustaining common ground. My sense is that most people, myself included at the start of the talk, thought of repair as a one-off in coordinated work. However, Allspaw was firm that repair is an ongoing process throughout all coordinated effort, and that members are always repairing. To that end, it got me thinking about egoless programming and how constant repairing requires a member to subsume their ego or at least make it more manageable for the good of the project.

<h4>Joint activity: Successes and failures</h4>

Allspaw went on to play clips of movies, particularly comedies, that make use of the lack of common ground for comedic effect. Most often, these were situations where one character misunderstands the meaning of a phrase, someone's tone, (the imperative for declarative); at times, with disastrous effects. (The Bedford Incident (1965)  with the improbably named Capt. Finlander was shown as an example--on a side note: perhaps the only time that I have heard the word 'Finlander' outside of my family and non-Swede-Finns.) This was contrasted with examples like a triple play in a baseball game, where everyone shares common ground and minimizes the overhead of such costs as redirection, communication, synchronization, etc. among team members.

The example that he provided that most resonated with me was his description of drivers on the road as joint activity. In his words, driving is an activity we all engage in with certain understandings of expectations and responsibilities, we seek to prevent anything that is detrimental to the flow of traffic, and we manage this activity without ever explicitly communicating to our fellow drivers and we will never do so at any point before or after driving. This is in direct contrast to the concept of a convoy, which is both driving and a joint activity but has brittle dependencies that make the activity vulnerable to breakdown unlike the experience of driving on a highway with other drivers.

He then went on to discuss some examples, including driving on a street and signaling to other drivers to make a left turn and mentioning the promise of driverless cars.

This of course brings us to the workplace. How can we make joint activity more like a triple play or driving on a highway? There's a seamlessness to those examples, where members don't get bogged down in procedural ritual (like checklists) or verboseness...because they don't have to: they are 'primed' for coordination with the basic compact and common ground.

<h4>Diversity and common ground || diversity vs. common ground</h4>
___
<br>

I couldn't stay for all the questions but one question that came up was cultivating diversity on a team and common ground. I think that the person asking this question was trying to understand how the concept of a common ground could coexist with a team made up of more than, in his terms not mine, 'white males.' This circles back to the uncomfortable feeling that I had when I wondered if common ground was a euphemism for homogeneity. When Allspaw did not give a definitive, prescriptive solution for the question, (and really, I think the best he could do was a sort of post-structuralist position on it), another member of the audience attempted to provide (unsolicited...) clarity for Allspaw by saying that perhaps the thing that is common ground on a team should be something like everyone having a CS degree, (which I found telling & problematic, in that difference needs to be subsumed rather than acknowledged...). 

In any case, I hope that having a CS degree is not the common ground for an engineering team I'm on, because I don't believe that a diploma necessarily signfies knowledge, nor do I think it's a particularly good measure of a compatible team member. What worried me about the latter audience comment was the danger of the desire for commonality that leads to the false belief that an arbitrary signifier means something more than it does and would encourage joint activity.

<h4>Final thoughts</h4>
___
<br>

These are all very specific examples and it's easy to think how it can't possibly apply to other subjects or tasks, but Allspaw challenges that coordinated effort and systems are applicable everywhere: surgery teams, airtraffic controllers, NASA space missions, and of course, software engineering teams. Skim through the examples I mentioned and it's quite easy to see how they might fit into the context of writing software. 

Seeing how seamless some joint activities are, possibly rooted in some very ancient human behavior that primes us for it, promises a lot for creating better systems of coordinated effort. Can we take advantage of some very old human behaviors to make life safer, more productive with _less_ effort?
