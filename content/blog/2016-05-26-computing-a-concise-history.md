In a better effort to contextualize what I'm learning as I learn to program, I started this book. "Computing: A Concise History" by Paul Cernuzzi is just what the title promises. Looking at the slim, tiny book it's hard to believe that the entirety of computing history could be discussed within it. It doesn't. What it is, is a survey of computing from about the 1930s onward focused on a few keys. If you were hoping to delve into earlier antecedents of modern computers like Jacquard's looms or Babbage's Analytical Engine, you won't find it here. 

Cernuzzi by trade is not a computer scientist nor programmer, but a historian of computing at the Smithsonian, and therefore, doesn't sacrifice narrative for the minutiae of technical design details. What he instead does is put forth several themes to understanding how we got to where we are today. They are: 
    
* __the digital paradigm__: control through binary form
* __convergence__: the intersection of different industries and knowledges giving birth to computing advances 
* __solid-state electronics__: computing advances, like the stored data principle, have been driven by improved efficiency with electronics
* __the human-machine interface__: how humans interact with machines 

It is a crash course in the history of computing, and at times certain histories need to be sacrificed for brevity--it's something that bothered me as I read the book. As previously mentioned, Jacquard gets a few passing mentions; Ada Lovelace's title as 'the world's first programmer' is judged as 'gives her too much credit' (!!) and no mention at all of her work or history; and there's little discussion of Babbage's work either, mostly that his Analytical Engine didn't work. 

And of course, more glaring omissions include John von Neumann and Grace Hopper. von Neumann's contributions to the field of computing including mentions of influential writing and talks, (which I believe was the basis of the lecture that impressed Kemeny in "Man and the Computer"), but Cernuzzi never explicitly states _what_ von Neumann wrote or cites these written works.

Grace Hopper is mentioned in passing as having been influential because of her work with the UNIVAC but not much more. 

There's a few strange personal comments, including chastising web designers and developers for websites that have "an angry fruit salad" of too many design elements; is that Cernuzzi's opinion or history's?

But the book works on the highest levels, where we get an eagle's eye view of of just how certain advancements in technology converged with social needs to give birth to modern computing as we experience it. The link between time-sharing and the client-server relationship was surprising and illuminating to me as a beginning programmer. It contextualized the client-server architecture in such a way that I could rationalize and accept why we use it, providing insight into something that seemed before to spring out of nowhere with little relation to the whole of modern programming. 

Another insight was to see how much serendipity played a role in computing history; advances were made by happy circumstances like a train ride from a conference that allowed several important figures in computing to meet and chat for a few hours, (J. C. R. Licklider among them), setting the stage for ARPANET. Tim Berners-Lee and scientists met by chance in the hallways of CERN, spurring intellectual discussion that leads to the Internet. And the examples go on...

It's a good book if we accept it for what it is: a starting point for discussion, a light read, and a jumping off point for deeper research.
